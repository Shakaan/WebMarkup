          During the Golden age, the Haarlem council decided to promote the
          pursuit of arts and history, in an attempt to better the economy. Many
          artists and craftsmen migrated to Haarlem and received commissions
          from the Haarlem council to decorate the city hall. The paintings
          commissioned were meant to show Haarlem's glorious history as well as
          Haarlem's glorious products. Famous painters, such as Frans Hals and
          Jacob van Ruisdael, contributed heavily to this.

        <p>
          In the City Center lies the Grote Markt, which houses a number of
          special historic buildings, including the town hall, the Vleeshal and
          the St. Bavokerk. The St. Bavokerk is a church with its tower almost
          reaching up to 80 meters. Many famous musicians, including Mozart,
          have been recorded to have played there. There is also the school
          building of the Stedelijk Gymnasium Haarlem, one of the earliest
          schools. In addition, there is a market twice a week on the Grote
          Markt and various events take place throughout the year, including the
          annual fair.
          <p>
            Important shopping streets run from Grote Markt in three directions,
            namely Grote Houtstraat, Barteljorisstraat and Zijlstraat. There are a
            number of small, characteristic shopping streets in the historic
            center, such as Warmoesstraat, Schagchelstraat, and Kleine Houtstraat.

          The Spaarne Rivier devides the city center into two parts. West of the
          river is the largest part of the city center. To the east is the part
          also known as the Spaarnwouderbuurt. There, you will find among other
          things, the only remaining city gate of Haarlem; The Amsterdamse
          Poort. The mill De Adriaan and Koepelgevangenis are also located here.
          Both banks of the Spaarne are connected by two monumental swing
          bridges, the Catherijnebrug and the Melkbrug and two drawbridges
          including the Gravestenenbrug, and a modern drawbridge. This brudge,
          popularly called the 'Verfroller', is officially called the Long
          Bridge. In the past there was also the Sint Nicolaas or Coral bridge
          between the Houtmarkt and the Koudehorn, but this has disappeared.
          There have been plans to bring this bridge back, but no action has
          been takes as of today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the buildings in the city center date from the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries. However, there is also a lot of modern architecture, such as the Toneelschuur and the new building around the Appelaar.
